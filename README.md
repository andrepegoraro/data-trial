# Clever Data Engineer Trial Project

## Goal of the Project:

At Clever, we are turning data into personalized and localized content so our readers can make well-informed decisions about any step of their real estate journey.

Please fork this repository and let us know when you've completed the project with a link to your fork.

Using the data set decribed below, and the Airflow-based data pipeline docker configuration, perform basic analysis for the chosen in `company_profiles_google_maps.csv`. There are basic errors on the DAG that you will need to fix for the pipeline to work properly. 

## Expectations
To perform this project you will need to:
* Perform transforms on the raw data and load them into a PostgreSQL database
* Be able to join datasets together in way for an analyst to be able to rank by a certain set of criteria (you can determine this criteria)
* Be able to filter the data by city or state so analysis can be performed by locality
* Given a locality, create a ranked list according to the criteria youâ€™ve chosen

**Bonus:**
* Interesting additional analysis based on the underlying data
* An example could be Review Sentiment, common themes among ratings, complaints, etc.

## Dataset
Moving company data set (files can be found at 'dags/scripts/data_examples' folder)
* fmcsa_companies.csv
* fmcsa_company_snapshot.csv
* fmcsa_complaints.csv
* fmcsa_safer_data.csv
* company_profiles_google_maps.csv
* customer_reviews_google.csv
